**Andrew Ribeiro - Andrew@kexp.io**

Talk given July 2018 to [Danbury AI](https://www.meetup.com/DanburyAI/events/251770683/)

Often when doing research in machine learning you need to visualize your data and results to gain insights. In addition,publications like https://distill.pub show us how much value well put together visualizations can add to the exposition of machine learning research. In this talk we will introduce the basics of a popular library for creating robust web-based data visualizations: D3.js.
